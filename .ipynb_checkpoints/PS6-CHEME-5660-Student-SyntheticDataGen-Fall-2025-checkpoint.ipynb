    "### Question 1: When is the Single Index Model Appropriate for Synthetic Data?\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the single index model we used to generate synthetic growth rates for individual assets from the market growth rates simulated using the HMM. The single index model is given by:\n",
    "$$G^{(t)}_i = \\alpha_i + \\beta_i G^{(t)}_M + \\epsilon^{(t)}_i$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Think about a portfolio of assets and discuss the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* __What characteristics should a set of assets have for the SIM to be a good model for generating synthetic data?__ (Hint: Think about what types of assets would be well-explained by market movements.)\n",
    "* __Can you think of scenarios or asset classes where the SIM might perform poorly?__ (Hint: Consider idiosyncratic events, sector-specific shocks, or company-specific news.)\n",
    "* __How might the choice of market index (SPY, DIA, Russell 2000, etc.) affect the quality of your synthetic data generation?__\n",
    "\n",
    "Put your discussion answers here.\n",
    "\n",
    "ANSWER: The asset should largely be influenced by market movements. Assets that move together due to macroeconomics and other market trends are well-explained by SIM as it assumes that there is only one core factor affecting the assets and that is the market. SIM would perform poorly for assets that are company-driven or sector-driven as these factors are independent of the larger market scenario. The choice of market idex is key as it should reflect the risk-factors driving the asset. A poor choice of market index would result in betas being misestimated and covariance being off, resulting in an inacurrate understanding of the simulation. "

    "\n",
    "Our synthetic data generation system relies on the Single Index Model and HMM predictions. However, real markets can behave unexpectedly due to idiosyncratic shocks.\n",
    "\n",

Perhaps there's a disappointing earnings announcement, regulatory concerns, or an executive departure. Despite the SIM predicting a stable or positive return based on the market movement, the stock's actual price drops.\n",

The single index model extends predictions to individual assets using market factors and asset-specific parameters.\n",
